This translates into time you wait while a document or image is retrieved off the network. There are a lot of different reasons for slowness, but they fall into several basic categories:

1. Bandwidth intensive web site design
2. Network backbone bottlenecks.
3. ISP bottlenecks.

We can do little about network backbone bottlenecks and poorly designed web sites, but complain. As ISPs, however, we can configure our hardware, software, and other provisions such that our customers get the most out of their equipment and their dollar. A few local ISPs, including pcOnline, provision their services to maximize throughput for their customers benefit.

pcOnline talks to its 33.6kb modems at 115.2kb/sec and so should you. You should configure you PC to talk to your 33.6kb modem at 115.2kb/sec. Why? To take full advantage of the data compression capability built into your modem. This will greatly increase the effective speed of transmission and increase your satisfaction with our service and the Internet.
