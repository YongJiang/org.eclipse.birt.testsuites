/**
 * <b>Regression description:</b>
 * <p>
 * BIRT 2.0 Scripted Data Set converted incorrectly in 2.1
 * <p>
 * First attachment in this file is a report design created in 2.0.1, which
 * defines a Scripted Data Set. Open the design in 2.1RC5, the BIRT designer
 * converts the design to 2.1 format. (Attachment 2 [edit] is the converted
 * design file). However visual inspection of the XML source reveals that the
 * data set definition contains both a "resultSet" structure and an identical
 * "resultSetHints" structure. The "resultSet" structure here is wrong - it
 * should have been removed during the conversion.
 * <p>
 * As it stands the extranueous "resultSet" does not stop the data set from
 * working so this is not a critical issue. But it should be removed.
 * <p>
 * <b>Test description:</b>
 * <p>
 * Open the 2.1 report, make sure that the resultSet list property is removed
 * after convertion.
